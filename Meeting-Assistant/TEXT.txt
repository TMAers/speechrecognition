HE BEGAN A CONFUSED COMPLAINT AGAINST THE WIZARD WHO HAD VANISHED BEHIND THE CURTAIN ON THE LEFT
GIVE NOT SO EARNEST A MIND TO THESE MUMMERIES CHILD
A GOLDEN FORTUNE AND A HAPPY LIFE
HE WAS LIKE UNTO MY FATHER IN A WAY AND YET WAS NOT MY FATHER
ALSO THERE WAS A STRIPLING PAGE WHO TURNED INTO A MAID
THIS WAS SO SWEET A LADY SIR AND IN SOME MANNER I DO THINK SHE DIED
BUT THEN THE PICTURE WAS GONE AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME
SISTER NELL DO YOU HEAR THESE MARVELS
TAKE YOUR PLACE AND LET US SEE WHAT THE CRYSTAL CAN SHOW TO YOU
LIKE AS NOT YOUNG MASTER THOUGH I AM AN OLD MAN
FORTHWITH ALL RAN TO THE OPENING OF THE TENT TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE AMISS BUT MASTER WILL WHO PEEPED OUT FIRST NEEDED NO MORE THAN ONE GLANCE
HE GAVE WAY TO THE OTHERS VERY READILY AND RETREATED UNPERCEIVED BY THE SQUIRE AND MISTRESS FITZOOTH TO THE REAR OF THE TENT
CRIES OF A NOTTINGHAM A NOTTINGHAM
BEFORE THEM FLED THE STROLLER AND HIS THREE SONS CAPLESS AND TERRIFIED
WHAT IS THE TUMULT AND RIOTING CRIED OUT THE SQUIRE AUTHORITATIVELY AND HE BLEW TWICE ON A SILVER WHISTLE WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT
NAY WE REFUSED THEIR REQUEST MOST POLITELY MOST NOBLE SAID THE LITTLE STROLLER
AND THEN THEY BECAME VEXED AND WOULD HAVE SNATCHED YOUR PURSE FROM US
I COULD NOT SEE MY BOY INJURED EXCELLENCE FOR BUT DOING HIS DUTY AS ONE OF CUMBERLAND'S SONS
SO I DID PUSH THIS FELLOW
IT IS ENOUGH SAID GEORGE GAMEWELL SHARPLY AND HE TURNED UPON THE CROWD
SHAME ON YOU CITIZENS CRIED HE I BLUSH FOR MY FELLOWS OF NOTTINGHAM
SURELY WE CAN SUBMIT WITH GOOD GRACE
TIS FINE FOR YOU TO TALK OLD MAN ANSWERED THE LEAN SULLEN APPRENTICE
BUT I WRESTLED WITH THIS FELLOW AND DO KNOW THAT HE PLAYED UNFAIRLY IN THE SECOND BOUT
SPOKE THE SQUIRE LOSING ALL PATIENCE AND IT WAS TO YOU THAT I GAVE ANOTHER PURSE IN CONSOLATION
COME TO ME MEN HERE HERE HE RAISED HIS VOICE STILL LOUDER
THE STROLLERS TOOK THEIR PART IN IT WITH HEARTY ZEST NOW THAT THEY HAD SOME CHANCE OF BEATING OFF THEIR FOES
ROBIN AND THE LITTLE TUMBLER BETWEEN THEM TRIED TO FORCE THE SQUIRE TO STAND BACK AND VERY VALIANTLY DID THESE TWO COMPORT THEMSELVES
THE HEAD AND CHIEF OF THE RIOT THE NOTTINGHAM APPRENTICE WITH CLENCHED FISTS THREATENED MONTFICHET
THE SQUIRE HELPED TO THRUST THEM ALL IN AND ENTERED SWIFTLY HIMSELF
NOW BE SILENT ON YOUR LIVES HE BEGAN BUT THE CAPTURED APPRENTICE SET UP AN INSTANT SHOUT
SILENCE YOU KNAVE CRIED MONTFICHET
HE FELT FOR AND FOUND THE WIZARD'S BLACK CLOTH THE SQUIRE WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH
THRUSTING OPEN THE PROPER ENTRANCE OF THE TENT ROBIN SUDDENLY RUSHED FORTH WITH HIS BURDEN WITH A GREAT SHOUT
A MONTFICHET A MONTFICHET GAMEWELL TO THE RESCUE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS THE SQUIRE'S FEW MEN REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGED BY ROBIN'S AND THE LITTLE STROLLER'S CRIES FOUGHT THEIR WAY TO HIM
GEORGE MONTFICHET WILL NEVER FORGET THIS DAY
WHAT IS YOUR NAME LORDING ASKED THE LITTLE STROLLER PRESENTLY
ROBIN FITZOOTH
AND MINE IS WILL STUTELEY SHALL WE BE COMRADES
RIGHT WILLINGLY FOR BETWEEN US WE HAVE WON THE BATTLE ANSWERED ROBIN
I LIKE YOU WILL YOU ARE THE SECOND WILL THAT I HAVE MET AND LIKED WITHIN TWO DAYS IS THERE A SIGN IN THAT
MONTFICHET CALLED OUT FOR ROBIN TO GIVE HIM AN ARM
FRIENDS SAID MONTFICHET FAINTLY TO THE WRESTLERS BEAR US ESCORT SO FAR AS THE SHERIFF'S HOUSE
IT WILL NOT BE SAFE FOR YOU TO STAY HERE NOW
PRAY FOLLOW US WITH MINE AND MY LORD SHERIFF'S MEN
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE WAS REACHED AND ADMITTANCE WAS DEMANDED
MASTER MONCEUX THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WAS MIGHTILY PUT ABOUT WHEN TOLD OF THE RIOTING
AND HENRY MIGHT RETURN TO ENGLAND AT ANY MOMENT
HAVE YOUR WILL CHILD IF THE BOY ALSO WILLS IT MONTFICHET ANSWERED FEELING TOO ILL TO OPPOSE ANYTHING VERY STRONGLY JUST THEN
HE MADE AN EFFORT TO HIDE HIS CONDITION FROM THEM ALL AND ROBIN FELT HIS FINGERS TIGHTEN UPON HIS ARM
BEG ME A ROOM OF THE SHERIFF CHILD QUICKLY
BUT WHO IS THIS FELLOW PLUCKING AT YOUR SLEEVE
HE IS MY ESQUIRE EXCELLENCY RETURNED ROBIN WITH DIGNITY
MISTRESS FITZOOTH HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER AND HER MAIDS AS SOON AS THEY HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE SO THAT ROBIN ALONE HAD THE CARE OF MONTFICHET
ROBIN WAS GLAD WHEN AT LENGTH THEY WERE LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
THE WINE DID CERTAINLY BRING BACK THE COLOR TO THE SQUIRE'S CHEEKS
THESE ESCAPADES ARE NOT FOR OLD GAMEWELL LAD HIS DAY HAS COME TO TWILIGHT
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME NOW
IT WILL BE NO DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME
NO THANKS I AM GLAD TO GIVE YOU SUCH EASY HAPPINESS
YOU ARE A WORTHY LEECH WILL PRESENTLY WHISPERED ROBIN THE WINE HAS WORKED A MARVEL
AY AND SHOW YOU SOME PRETTY TRICKS
YOUNG FITZOOTH HAD BEEN COMMANDED TO HIS MOTHER'S CHAMBER SO SOON AS HE HAD COME OUT FROM HIS CONVERSE WITH THE SQUIRE
THERE BEFELL AN ANXIOUS INTERVIEW MISTRESS FITZOOTH ARGUING FOR AND AGAINST THE SQUIRE'S PROJECT IN A BREATH
MOST OF ALL ROBIN THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER WHAT WOULD HE COUNSEL
IF FOR A WHIM YOU BEGGAR YOURSELF I CANNOT STAY YOU
BUT TAKE IT WHILST I LIVE AND WEAR MONTFICHET'S SHIELD IN THE DAYS WHEN MY EYES CAN BE REJOICED BY SO BRAVE A SIGHT FOR YOU WILL NE'ER DISGRACE OUR SCUTCHEON I WARRANT ME
THE LAD HAD CHECKED HIM THEN
NEVER THAT SIR HE HAD SAID
HE WAS IN DEEP CONVERSE WITH THE CLERK AND ENTERED THE HALL HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM
NOW TO BED BOY
TIS LATE AND I GO MYSELF WITHIN A SHORT SPACE
DISMISS YOUR SQUIRE ROBIN AND BID ME GOOD E E N
AS ANY IN ENGLAND I WOULD SAY SAID GAMEWELL PROUDLY THAT IS IN HIS DAY
YET HE WILL TEACH YOU A FEW TRICKS WHEN MORNING IS COME
THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO ALTER HIS SLEEPING ROOM TO ONE NEARER TO GAMEWELL'S CHAMBER
PRESENTLY HE CROSSED THE FLOOR OF HIS ROOM WITH DECIDED STEP
WILL CRIED HE SOFTLY AND STUTELEY WHO HAD CHOSEN HIS COUCH ACROSS THE DOOR OF HIS YOUNG MASTER'S CHAMBER SPRANG UP AT ONCE IN ANSWER
WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER TO THE BOWER THERE IS A WAY DOWN TO THE COURT FROM MY WINDOW
REST AND BE STILL UNTIL I WARN YOU
THE HOURS PASSED WEARILY BY AND MOVEMENT COULD YET BE HEARD ABOUT THE HALL
AT LAST ALL WAS QUIET AND BLACK IN THE COURTYARD OF GAMEWELL
WILL WHISPERED ROBIN OPENING HIS DOOR AS HE SPOKE ARE YOU READY
THEY THEN RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY AND UNDER THE BETTER LIGHT MADE A SAFE CROSSING OF THE STABLE ROOFS
ROBIN ENTERED THE HUT DRAGGING THE UNWILLING ESQUIRE AFTER HIM
BE NOT SO FOOLISH FRIEND SAID FITZOOTH CROSSLY
THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING BEFORE AND ABOUT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRENTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSION
THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUTELEY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAP MOUTH OF THIS PIT
FITZOOTH'S HAND RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO HIM
ROBIN CAREFULLY DESCENDED THE LADDER AND FOUND HIMSELF SOON UPON FIRM ROCKY GROUND
STUTELEY WAS BY HIS SIDE IN A FLASH AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN FEELING ABOUT THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS VAULT
FROM THE BLACKNESS BEHIND THE LIGHT THEY HEARD A VOICE WARRENTON'S
SAVE ME MASTERS BUT YOU STARTLED ME RARELY
CRIED HE WAVING THE LANTHORN BEFORE HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WERE NO GHOSTS IN FRONT OF HIM
ENQUIRED ROBIN WITH HIS SUSPICIONS STILL UPON HIM
TRULY SUCH A HORSE SHOULD BE WORTH MUCH IN NOTTINGHAM FAIR
NAY NAY LORDING ANSWERED WARRENTON WITH A HALF LAUGH
WARRENTON SPOKE THUS WITH SIGNIFICANCE TO SHOW ROBIN THAT HE WAS NOT TO THINK GEOFFREY'S CLAIMS TO THE ESTATE WOULD BE PASSED BY
ROBIN FITZOOTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBTS OF WARRENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBORING THEM
HIS TONES RANG PLEASANTLY ON WARRENTON'S EARS AND FORTHWITH A GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS HERALDED BETWEEN THEM
THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGE WAY LED FROM THE HUT IN THE PLEASANCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT GEOFFREY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FOREST
HE IMPLORES US TO BE DISCREET AS THE GRAVE IN THIS MATTER FOR IN SOOTH HIS LIFE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF OUR HANDS
THEY REGAINED THEIR APARTMENT APPARENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE HOUSEHOLD OF GAMEWELL
